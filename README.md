# Can You Hack It

<https://hack.ainfosec.com/>

Automatic scripts for the hacking challenge.

## Usage

Just open DevTools by pressing <kbd>F12</kbd> in you browser, and then copy and paste the code in the console.

**Notice**: `Super ROT` and `XOR` rely on `window.englishCommonWords`, you must run `english-common-words.js` in you browser first.

(All scripts are tested on my Chrome 71)
